# 9-9-2021 - Discussion with Professor Kwiat

The Team had a meeting with our sponsered professor, Professor Kwiat, about the project to clarify some of the project. Additionally he explained how the educational device would imitate how quantum entangelment would behave in the real world through the zoom whiteboard.

# 9-11-2021 - Team meeting for project proposal

We decided to start the project propsal and look for some parts. I was looking up the different types of sensors we could use as input for the two sections of 3 foot LEDs so that there would be inputs at every 2 inches for the prototype. Initally I was looking at already created touch capacitive switches but they were only around 3 inches each at $7 per module which would be much to expensive for the given budget. I also looked at flex sensors and resistive sensors but they had there own problems. Ian ended up finding a capacitive touch board that allowed for 12 capactive touch imputs that we would have to make ourselves out of some conductive material.
