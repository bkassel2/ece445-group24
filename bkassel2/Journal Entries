9/9/21 - First meeting with Professor Kwiat

We finally were able to meet with Professor Kwiat. He ran us through his vision for the project, as he was the one sponsoring it. We were able to listen to him for about an hour
while he drew a rough design of what we were going to build, along with some math that helped us with the understanding of quantum physics.
