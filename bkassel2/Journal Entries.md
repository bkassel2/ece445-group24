# 9/9/21 - First meeting with Professor Kwiat

We finally were able to meet with Professor Kwiat. He ran us through his vision for the project, as he was the one sponsoring it. We were able to listen to him for about an hour
while he drew a rough design of what we were going to build, along with some math that helped us with the understanding of quantum physics (see 9-9 Kwiat Drawing.PNG). This was
very useful as it allowed us to get a brief understanding of what we were going to take on.

# 9/11/21 - Second meeting with Professor Kwiat

We met with the professor again to go over our proposal and talk about budget. He was willing to cover the costs of making the project a little higher quality only if we were 
able to make a working prototype with cheaper parts. While this is doable, there is going to be a bit of extra work in our project now. Work on the proposal continues.


# 9/14/21 - We met with the TA to discuss the block diagram

We had another meeting with Josephine today to discuss our Design Document. We were instructed to change the block diagram to include data and power lines with specific colors. She also gave some feedback on the visual aid, which we are going to make a bit more sophisticated. Overall, the meeting went well, but we still have a lot left for design


# Week of 9/20 - Design Document

We are finally doing the rest of our design document. We have been able to finalize the first draft of our block diagram, and things are looking good. We are having nightly meetings on discord to just work through stuff a little bit at a time. We have also started looking for parts and microcontrollers. None of us have a huge knowledge of microcontrollers, so the process is just a lot of research. We will have to get help with how everything goes together.

# Week of 9/27 - Finished Design Doc and Microcontroller Help

I don't think we had too many problems with our design document overall. During meetings with Professor Kwiat, we were able to get help with our problem and proposed solution, visual aids, and high level requirements. The only remaining issue is the parts list, which includes a microcontroller. I reached our to Professor Arne and Evan, a TA for this class. The plan is to meet with either one of them to discuss how we would do our project using a microcontroller.

# Week of 10/4 - Meeting with Evan, Parts List, and the Introduction of the Raspberry Pi

Well, the meeting with Evan was pretty condescending, but helpful. Turns out that it would be nearly impossible to run the LEDs, touch sensors, and displays all from a microcontroller. After a meeting with Professor Arne, we have been given permission to use a Raspberry Pi 3 to help with the displays only. This is a huge boost for our team, as it makes the project significantly easier. We are also researching new parts given this new information and are hoping to have everything researched and purchased by next week. Professor Kwiat ordered the Raspi we would be using for this project pictured below.
