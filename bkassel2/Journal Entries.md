# 9/9/21 - First meeting with Professor Kwiat

We finally were able to meet with Professor Kwiat. He ran us through his vision for the project, as he was the one sponsoring it. We were able to listen to him for about an hour
while he drew a rough design of what we were going to build, along with some math that helped us with the understanding of quantum physics (see 9-9 Kwiat Drawing.PNG). This was
very useful as it allowed us to get a brief understanding of what we were going to take on.

# 9/11/21 - Second meeting with Professor Kwiat

We met with the professor again to go over our proposal and talk about budget. He was willing to cover the costs of making the project a little higher quality only if we were 
able to make a working prototype with cheaper parts. While this is doable, there is going to be a bit of extra work in our project now. Work on the proposal continues.


# 9-14-2021 - Meeting with TA
Had a meeting with our TA and got feedback on our Design Document. We needed to fix the Block Diagram that Ian created since it did not include which lines where what and the fixed the coloring for data and eletric lines.

# 9-15-2021 - Finsihed the project proposal for the class
Our group met up at 6 and finished working on the project propsal that was being submitted for the class. I worked on filling out the problem and solution slide in addition to creating some visual aids for the proposal. I also helped fill out the decribtion for the subsustems and block diagram.

# 9-23-2021 - 9-30-2021 - Worked on the design document
Worked on the design documents. After going to the decoument check on 9/24 we modified some of our requirement and verficaitions. In addition we where looking for all the parts we planned on using. Planed on using a microcontroller to process 2 VGA outputs and control the LED and touch capactiors. Looked up ways a microcontroller can process some VGA output. Found some sources such as http://tinyvga.com/ , https://blog.thomaspoulet.fr/bit-banged-vga/. Looked into getting a knob so our device can have some physcial speed control. Evan one of the TAs in the course notified us that driving VGA from a microcontroller might be outside the scope of this course in an email.

Had a video meeting with Evan who mentioned some limiations for the touch capcactiros not working after 4 feet of wires and the fact that we should not drive VGA displays with a microcontroller. We talked about alternatives for the display output and the concerns with the touch capcactiros did not affect out intended use case. Some alternatives included using multiple microcontrollers one to process logic and two more for each monitor. We also started talking about using a raspberry pi to drive the displays while processing everything else on the microcontroller. Evan also mentioned that we should probably use ps2 keyboards since their protocal are easier to use.

# 10-5-2021
I created a flow chart to add to our design document for how the software would run.

We had the design document review with the professor and some of the TAs. We talked to the professor and where allowed to use the raspberry pi to output our display for this project.

# 10-6-2021 - 10-11-2021
Found a new microcontroller since we are moving to outputting the display on the raspi. We looked for one that could transmit data to the raspi and process 2 LEDs, two ps2 keyboards, and the capacitive touch breakoutboards which needed a spi and sda pin on the microcontroller. We also started working on the PCB to try and get it in for the first round of PCBs. Ended up not creating the design in time for that.

# 10-13-2021
Ian finished the first draft of our PCB and check it with a TA. He also ordered it.

# 10-15-2021
We ordered all of our parts that we decided on and messaged our sponsered professor to order the LEDs, raspberry pi and power supply.

# 10-20-2021
I went to professor Kwiat office and grabbed all the parts that came in from Amazon. Additionally the Ian recieved the PCBs and the other parts that we have ordered has arrived in the business office.

# 10-23-2021
Relized we forgot to order some of the resistors and other small parts for the PCB and placed the order.
